## Introduction

## Initializing the project

You can create a new Spring Boot app with all the Camunda dependencies by visiting the [Camunda Initializer](https://start.camunda.com/) website.
This is similar to [Spring Boot Initializer](https://start.spring.io/). 
You can configure the Group, Artifact and Java Version for the project.
Click on `Generate Project` to download your maven project as a zip file which you can extract and start working.

Below is how your project is structured. 
The `pom.xml` file defined your maven project.
The `Application.java` file is responsible to run your Spring Boot app.
The configuration for the Camunda engine is defined in `application.yaml` file 
and the process is defined in `process.bpmn` file. 

```bash
> tree .
.
|-- pom.xml
`-- src
    `-- main
        |-- java
        |   `-- codes
        |       `-- shubham
        |           `-- Application.java
        `-- resources
            |-- application.yaml
            `-- process.bpmn
```

The `process.bpmn` file is `XML` file that represents the BPMN diagram of the process
which can be viewed and edited using the Camunda modeler. 

> You can install the Camunda modeler by visiting [Camunda downloads site](https://camunda.com/download/modeler/) or by using brew on mac.

## Camunda Modeler and BPMN Diagrams

Below is how the process will look like on opening the Camunda modeler.

<BlogImage src={CamundaModelerPNG} alt="" />

The "Say hello to admin" process is a user process. 
You can identify this by looking at the icon on the process block. 
Here, it's of a person meaning this process will wait for someone's approval. 
If there is a gear icon on it, then it means the process will wait for a code to get completed.

> You can change the component type by clicking on the component and then clicking the settings icon hovering next to it. 
 Camunda supports nearly all the BPMN2.0 diagrams. A list can be found [here](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/bpmn/bpmn-coverage/).

To test the workflow, you can visit the `tasklist` pannel on the Camunda server and click `start process` on the top left.
You'll see all the processes here.
For now, click on `camunda-learning-process`. 
The business key is not mandatory, you can just click start. 
This task can be viewed in your filters.

> If by default you don't have any filter, just create a new filter by clicking on the create filter button on the tasklist page.

But you cannot click on the complete button. 
This is because the task is not assigned to you.
You can assign the task to anyone by visiting the cockpit and clicking on the process.
The number on the component describes the number of pending tasks.
You can click on the `Process Instance ID` to jump to a particular task.

Go to the `user tasks` tab and click on the assignee edit button.
Let's assign admin as the assignee.

Now you can go back to the `tasklist` and click on the complete button signifying you approve the task.

## Extending the Camunda engine

Above we explored the Camunda server instance and the Camunda modeler.
Here, let's try to extend the original Camunda engine with some features.

### Configuring the engine properties

The configuration file for the engine is called `application.yaml` located inside the resources directory.
You can configure many different properties like the user id and password or maybe the port and route for the engine.
A huge list of all the Camunda engine parameters can be found [here](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/spring-boot-integration/configuration/#camunda-engine-properties).
Apart from that, you can also use [Spring Boot parameters](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/application-properties.html) for configuring the server. 

For now, let's configure the port to be `8096`, route to `camunda-engine` and a default filter for 'All Tasks'.
The port and route are Spring Boot properties while filter is related to Camunda.

```yaml
server:
    port: 8096
    servlet:
    contextPath: /camunda-engine

camunda:
    bpm:
        filter:
            create: All tasks

```

Compiling the app and running it will run the engine at port `8096` and you can verify this by visiting [localhost:8096/camunda-engine](http://localhost:8096/camunda-engine).
