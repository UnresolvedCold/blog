## Problem 

I use a dual-booted ROG with **Ubuntu 22.10** and **Windows 10** for development, along with a **MacBook Air 2020**.
Every time I begin a new project that makes use of a new tech stack, I am required to take some time to set up the environment on all 3 machines.
And sometimes, my laziness compels me to use only one machine instead of setting up other ones. 
The issue is that I don't want to go through the same setup process again and again. 

The same problem exists on a bigger scale too. 
In [GreyOrange](https://www.greyorange.com/), I've seen my supervisors spending a lot of time helping freshers set up their new laptops. 
And even after following the setup guide on confluence, it took me a lot of time to build my first project successfully.
Imagine helping 300 freshers set up their laptops for a particular project. 

Plus, the building process can be different for different Operating Systems. 
Wouldn't it be great to use a system that your CICD platform uses?

These problems can be solved using **dev containers** that only require `Docker` and `git` installed on your machine. 

## Dev containers

Dev containers are just Docker containers that have all the tools and tech stacks ready to start development. 
All you need to do is establish a connection to your container and start coding. 
And this configuration can be distributed using a version control system like `git`. 
Thus anyone can run these Docker containers and start development on their machine. 
GitHub codespace uses dev container configurations to set up your cloud development environment. 
You can also customize your dev container using a Docker file configuration. 

## Dev container custom configurations

A simple dev container configuration has a `.devcontainer` directory consisting of `devcontainer.json` and a `Dockerfile`.
The `devcontainer.json` contains all the configurations used by the container while `Dockerfile` contains the instruction to create a Docker container. 
You can also use an image from the Docker hub directly by using the `image` attribute. 

#### `Directory structure`
```bash
.devcontainer
├── Dockerfile
└── devcontainer.json
```

#### `devcontainer.json`
```json
{
	"name": "Hello DevContainer",   // This is the name of the container
    
    // build defines the image configurations
    // Instead of building you can use `image` attribute to provide the docker image hosted on Docker hub
    "build": {  
        "dockerfile": "Dockerfile", // This is the Dockerfile located at '.devcontainer/Dockerfile'
        "context": "..",            // This is where the project lies
        "args": {                   // Anything supplied to Dockerfile as an argument
            "PYTHON_VERSION": "3.9" 
        }
    },

	// Features to add to the dev container. More info: https://containers.dev/features.
	// "features": {},

	// Use 'forwardPorts' to make a list of ports inside the container available locally.
	// "forwardPorts": [],

	// Will run these after the container is created
    // Generally used to install the dependencies
	// "postCreateCommand": "pip install -r requirements.txt",

    // You can use root as remoteUser but it's not advisable to do so
	"remoteUser": "root"
}
```

#### `Dockerfile`
```docker
ARG PYTHON_VERSION
FROM python:${PYTHON_VERSION}.0-slim
# And other setup instructions
```

## Open your container in VSCode

To connect to a dev container using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you need to install [Dev Containers](vscode:extension/ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension. 
You can open your current directory in a dev container by clicking `F1` and selecting `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`. 
You can also choose `Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container` in case you want to build the Docker image once again. 

<BlogImageWithContext src={ReopenInaContainer} alt="Reopen folder in a container" width="768" aspectRatio="16/9"/>

This will take some time in building the container and installing the tools. 
Once completed, you can verify the connection by looking at the left end of the [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) window.
It should display `Dev Container: <Container name> @ <Operating system>` 

<BlogImageWithContext src={DevcontainerConnected} alt="Succcessfully connected to Dev Container" width="768" aspectRatio="16/9"/>

> Note: The extensions are gone. For your dev container, you'll need to add your extensions once again.

You can also check the python version to confirm if it's installed properly.
```bash
> root@2a35d5d14816:/workspaces/devcontainers# python --version
Python 3.9.0
```

## Open your container in a browser

You can also use the power of VSCode from your browser using [github.dev](https://github.com/github/dev) editor. 
You need to host your project on GitHub for this to work. 
Let's do that. 

First, you will need to add git features in `devcontainer.json` file.
This will enable us to use `git` and `github cli` from inside the container. 
You can also enable `ssh` using the `sshd` feature. 
A list of available features can be found at [containers.dev/features](https://containers.dev/features). 

```json
    ...
    "features": {
        "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/git:1": {},
        "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/github-cli:1": {},	
        "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/sshd:1": {}
    },
    ...
``` 

Then rebuild the container by pressing `F1` -> `Rebuild Container`.
Now you can use `git` and `gh` inside your container. 

```bash
> git init
> git add . 
> git commit -m "Init"
> gh auth login # Here you can create a new ssh key for your container
> gh repo create hello-devcontainer --public --source . --push
✓ Created repository GO-Shubham-Kumar/hello-devcontainer on GitHub
✓ Added remote git@github.com:GO-Shubham-Kumar/hello-devcontainer.git

 * [new branch]      HEAD -> master
Branch 'master' set up to track remote branch 'master' from 'origin'.
✓ Pushed commits to git@github.com:GO-Shubham-Kumar/hello-devcontainer.git
```

The above procedure creates a new repository and pushes the project commits to it. 
I can see my project at [https://github.com/GO-Shubham-Kumar/hello-devcontainer](https://github.com/GO-Shubham-Kumar/hello-devcontainer).

Now we have our code on GitHub.
It's time to open a devcontainer using gitub.dev. 
For this simply visit your GitHub repo and change the URL from `github.com` to `github.dev`. 
This will launch a new VSCode-style window with all your tools available. 

<BlogImageWithContext src={BrowserCode} alt="Opening VSCode style editor in browser" width="768" aspectRatio="16/9"/>

> Note: github.dev is a lightweight editor which does not support a terminal. If you want to use the terminal, you should switch to GitHub Codespaces. 

## Creating a dev container using templates available

Above, I showed you how to configure a dev container using a test repository. 
Now, I'll show you how to use available templates to run services like `PostgreSQL` along with your container.

In [GreyOrange](https://www.greyorange.com/), we have a project that uses `SpringBoot` and `PostgreSQL`. 
We need a list of databases to run the test case for this project.
Let's try to configure our dev container to have a `PostgreSQL` service along with the databases required. 

Summary of things we need.

1. Java 8 and Maven
1. PostgreSQL 9.6
1. Populate the databases 

You can visit [container templates](https://containers.dev/templates.html) to search for a required template.
We will use, [Java & Postgres](https://github.com/devcontainers/templates/tree/main/src/java-postgres) template. 
This template allows us to configure the Java version, package manager and PostgreSQL version. 

> In case your template isn't available, you will need to create your `Dockerfile` & `docker-compose` files.

From your [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor, 
Click `F1` -> `Dev Containers: Add Dev Container Configuration Files...`. 
Click on  `Show All Definitions` and select `Java & PostgreSQL`. 
I'm using version `8-bullseye` with Maven so I'll select them. 
After a few moments, [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) will create a `.devcontainer` directory with `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml` & `devcontainer.json`.

Looking at the generated code it seems like we require some modifications for this to work properly.

First, we want to initialize the databases as per the `./misc/database_creator.sql`. 
This file contains all the databases we require to run the test cases. 
This can be done by adding an entry to the `db` -> `volume` as `../misc/database_creator.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/database_creator.sql` in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

Second, the Java image should be `java:8-bullseye`, not `java:0-8-bullseye` which was generated by the generator. 

Third, we need `Postgres:9.6`, the generated one point to the latest image.

#### `devcontainer.json`
```json
// For format details, see https://aka.ms/devcontainer.json. For config options, see the
// README at: https://github.com/devcontainers/templates/tree/main/src/java-postgres
{
	"name": "Java & PostgreSQL",
	"dockerComposeFile": "docker-compose.yml",
	"service": "app",
	"workspaceFolder": "/workspaces/${localWorkspaceFolderBasename}"
}
```

#### `Dockerfile`
```docker
# Changed java:0-8-bullseye to java:8-bullseye
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/java:8-bullseye

ARG INSTALL_MAVEN="true"
ARG MAVEN_VERSION=""

ARG INSTALL_GRADLE="false"
ARG GRADLE_VERSION=""

RUN if [ "${INSTALL_MAVEN}" = "true" ]; then su vscode -c "umask 0002 && . /usr/local/sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh && sdk install maven \"${MAVEN_VERSION}\""; fi \
    && if [ "${INSTALL_GRADLE}" = "true" ]; then su vscode -c "umask 0002 && . /usr/local/sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh && sdk install gradle \"${GRADLE_VERSION}\""; fi

```

#### `docker-compose.yml`
```yaml
version: '3.8'

volumes:
  postgres-data:

services:
  app:
    container_name: javadev
    build: 
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    environment:
      # NOTE: POSTGRES_DB/USER/PASSWORD should match values in db container
        POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
        POSTGRES_USER: postgres
        POSTGRES_DB: postgres
        # We will populate the database using database_creator.sql
        # POSTGRES_HOSTNAME: postgresdb 

    volumes:
      - ../..:/workspaces:cached
    command: sleep infinity

    # Runs app on the same network as the database container, allows "forwardPorts" in devcontainer.json function.
    network_mode: service:db

    # Use "forwardPorts" in **devcontainer.json** to forward an app port locally. 
    # (Adding the "ports" property to this file will not forward from a Codespace.)

  db:
    container_name: postgresdb
    image: postgres:9.6
    restart: always
    volumes:
      # Run the below script as an initialization script 
      - ../misc/database_creator.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/database_creator.sql
      # We no longer require this
      # - postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      # NOTE: POSTGRES_DB/USER/PASSWORD should match values in app container
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      # We will create our databases using misc/database_creator.sql
      # POSTGRES_DB: postgres

    # Add "forwardPorts": ["5432"] to **devcontainer.json** to forward PostgreSQL locally.
    # (Adding the "ports" property to this file will not forward from a Codespace.)
```

The above configurations will run `PostgreSQL` along with our app. 
You can also view this combination in Docker Desktop.

Let's verify the `Java` and `Maven` versions.

```bash
> java -version
openjdk version "1.8.0_352"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (Temurin)(build 1.8.0_352-b08)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (Temurin)(build 25.352-b08, mixed mode)
> mvn -version
Apache Maven 3.8.7 (b89d5959fcde851dcb1c8946a785a163f14e1e29)
Maven home: /usr/local/sdkman/candidates/maven/current
Java version: 1.8.0_352, vendor: Temurin, runtime: /usr/local/sdkman/candidates/java/8.0.352-tem/jre
Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: UTF-8
OS name: "linux", version: "5.15.49-linuxkit", arch: "aarch64", family: "unix"
```

Let's compile the project.

```bash
> mvn clean install
...
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Total time:  35:03 min
[INFO] Finished at: 2023-01-08T00:05:51Z
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

It took a while but the build was successful.
