## Problem 

For some context, I use a dual-booted ROG with **Ubuntu 22.10** and **Windows 10** for development, along with a **MacBook Air 2020**.
Every time I begin a new project that makes use of a new tech stack, I am required to take some time to set up the environment on all 3 machines.
And my laziness compels me to use only one machine instead of setting up other ones. 
The issue is that I don't want to go through the same setup process once again. 

The same problem exists on a bigger scale too. 
In GreyOrange, I've seen my supervisors spending a lot of time helping freshers set up their new laptops. 
Even after following the setup guide on confluence, it took me a lot of time to build my first project successfully.
Imagine helping 300 freshers set up their laptops for a particular project. 

Plus, the building process can be different for different Operating Systems. 
Wouldn't it be great to use a system that your CICD platform uses?

These problems can be solved using **dev containers**. 

## Dev containers

Dev containers are just Docker containers that have all the tools and tech stacks ready to start development. 
All you need to do is establish an ssh connection to your container and start coding. 
And this configuration can be distributed using a version control system like `git`. 
GitHub codespace uses dev container configurations to set up your cloud development environment. 
You can also customize your dev container using a Docker file configuration. 

## Dev container custom configurations

A simple dev container configuration has a `.devcontainer` directory consisting of `devcontainer.json` and a `Dockerfile`.
The `devcontainer.json` contains all the configurations used by the container while `Dockerfile` contains the instruction to create a Docker container. 

#### `Directory structure`
```bash
.devcontainer
├── Dockerfile
└── devcontainer.json
```

#### `devcontainer.json`
```json
{
	"name": "Hello DevContainer",   // This is the name of the container
    
    // build defines the image configurations
    "build": {  
        "dockerfile": "Dockerfile", // This is the Dockerfile located at '.devcontainer/Dockerfile'
        "context": "..",            // This is where the project lies
        "args": {                   // Anything supplied to Dockerfile as an argument
            "SayHello": "Hello Frnd!!!" 
        }
    },

	// Features to add to the dev container. More info: https://containers.dev/features.
	// "features": {},

	// Use 'forwardPorts' to make a list of ports inside the container available locally.
	// "forwardPorts": [],

    // Container-specific settings like VSCode configurations
    // "settings": {
    // },

	// Will run these after the container is created
    // Generally used to install the dependencies
	// "postCreateCommand": "pip install -r requirements.txt",

    // You can use root as remoteUser but it's not advisable to do so
	"remoteUser": "vscode"
}
