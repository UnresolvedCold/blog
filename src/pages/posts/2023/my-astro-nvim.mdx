## What is NVim and AstroVim? 

`NVim` is a terminal based editor made to enhance Vim by adding a wide range of features and configurations.

`AstroVim` is a set of pre-configured plugins that gives you a headstart by providing an initial setup
consisting most of the generally used plugins such as `Tree-sitter`.

There are many other standard configurations such as [NvChad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad) 
and [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/) that you can look into.
And ofcourse, you can also start writing your config files from scratch. 

## Prerequisites

1. You will need NVim version greater than `0.8.5`
1. Get yourself familiar with `Lua` scripting language as all the config files use this 

## Installation steps

Before doing anything else, make a backup of your current configuration.

```
# Backup of config files
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak

# Backup of shared folder
mv ~/.local/share/nvim ~/.local/share/nvim.bak
```

Now, install `AstroVim`. This is just cloning the [AstroVim](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim) repository to your config directory.

Next, create your personal config repository by using the template provided [here](https://github.com/AstroNvim/user_example).
Clone this repository at `~/config/nvim/lua/user` directory.
This is where you will add your own customizations.

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim ~/.config/nvim

# Cloning my config repository
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/UnresolvedCold/astro-nvim-configurations ~/.config/nvim/lua/user


# Launch NVim
nvim 
```

The first launch of `nvim` will load the plugin manager. 
This will install all the required plugins. 

You can quit this screen by entering `q`. 

## Key bindings

### Useful Vim key bindings 

Vim works in different modes.

1. Normal mode (Esc) - This is the default mode where you can navigate through a file 
2. Insert mode (i, o, A, O, ...) - This mode enables you to edit the file
3. Terminal Mode (:) - You can enter commands in terminal mode
4. Visual mode (v, ctrl + V) - For manipulating multiple lines

Here are some of the useful key bindings that are generally used by me (will keep updating).

| Function | Mode | Key | How to remember? |
| --- | --- | ---| --- |
| Move to the end of the line | Normal | $ | This symbol is used for end in regex |
| Move to the beginning of the line | Normal | ^ | This symbol is used for beggining in regex |
| Insert mode at the end of the line | Normal | A | Appednd | 
| Insert mode at the beginning of the line | Normal | I | Insert |
| Insert mode after the cursor | Normal | a | insert after as A was for line |
| Insert mode before the cursor | Normal | i | insert before as I was for line |
| Undo | Normal | u | undo |
| Yank (~Copy) | Normal | yy | yank yank |
| Delete line (~Cut) | Normal | dd | delete delete |
| Put (~Paste)| Normal | p, P | paste |
| View Vim build in tutorial | Terminal | :Tutor | |

The delete command works the same as cut in general. 
`p` pastes the content in the next line while `P` pastes the content in the previous line.

During the inital days of Vim, it's recommended that you go through the tutorial frequently and don't try to memorize all the key bindings all at once.

### AstroNVim key bindings

There is a leader key (by default `<spc>`) that triggers the key cmd mode. 
If you'll press `<spc>`, it will display all the other key bindings that you can use.

| Function | Key | 
| --- | --- |
| Quit Vim | <spc> q |
| Quit the current buffer | <spc> c |
| Toggle Explorer | <spc> o |
| Save a file | <spc> w | 
| Comment a line | <spc> / |
| Git related  | <spc> g |
| Find | <spc> f |
| Todos | <spc> T |
| Terminal | <spc> T f |
| Close Terminal | <F7> |
| Next anything | <spc> ] |
| Next buffer | <spc> ] b |
| Previous buffer | <spc> [ b |
