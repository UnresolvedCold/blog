This is how I quickly hosted the platform where this blog exists that you are reading right now.

You'll need a text editor with dev container support (like **VS Code**), **Docker** and **Github account**. 
For deployment you can use one of the many static site hosting platforms. 
We would be using astro as the building stack. Thanks for the advice [Guruvardhan](https://mobile.twitter.com/guruxkancharla).

Heroku, AWS, Vercel are good options to explore but I'll go with **[firebase hosting](https://firebase.google.com/)** (no particular reason).   
If you need a custom domain, say hello to [porkbun](https://porkbun.com/). 

## Understanding the flow

Above is what we want to do. `src` contains all the things we want to update at any point in a time.

`src/pages/*.astro` contains the main view of our website. The layouts are defined at `src/layouts`

Let's start from the end. You need a GitHub account because that's where we'll implement our magical **CICD** pipelines.
CICD is a huge thing in itself and  you should explore this.
For us it's just a way to update our website on every new post.
If you want to use any other similar tools like Jenkins, go for it. 

You're free to go and select any templates form the [astro library](https://astro.build/themes/blog/). 
I am going with [Lance Ross's template](https://basicblog.lanceross.xyz/) because of it's minimalist and elegant design. 
It also has a dark/light theme button.
