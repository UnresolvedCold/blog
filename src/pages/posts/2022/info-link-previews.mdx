## General Introduction

Using social networking apps, you can add a preview to the URL you share.
As a result, the reader can get a decent notion of the contents.

<BlogImageWithContext src={LinkPreviewDemo} aspectRatio="1" width="200" alt="Preview of telegram">
  <div>
    The link shared on Dec 18 shows a preview consisting of a title and
    description.
  </div>
  <div>The link shared on Dec 20 extends this preview by adding an image.</div>
  <div>
    This image is dynamically created by the server on receiving the request
    from the social media app.
  </div>
</BlogImageWithContext>

#### A bit of history

Facebook launched the open graph protocol in 2010.
This made it possible for the creator to distribute certain data for social media use.
This is done using the `meta` tags.
Later on, Twitter launched its tags for Twitter cards.
So now, Twitter and Telegram follow Twitter's meta tags, while Facebook and WhatsApp follow Open Graph's protocol.
Twitter respects the Open Graph protocol if Twitter tags are missing.
But it's always good to have both versions defined.

## Defining meta tags

`meta` tags are defined inside the `head`.
You can define Open Graph tags using `og:<key>` and Twitter tags using `Twitter:<key>`.
All tags are documented in [Open Graph Documentation](https://ogp.me/) and [Twitter Cards Documentation](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/cards/guides/getting-started).
Here, I will restrict myself to `title`, `description`, `image` & `URL` tags as our main focus is on creating dynamic images of a website.

Let's see how to define meta tags.
For this, you can create a simple `HTML` site with the following contents.

#### `link-preview.html`

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- Open Graph metas -->
    <meta property="og:type" content="website" />
    <meta property="og:url" content="a test url" />
    <meta property="og:title" content="My first link preview" />
    <meta property="og:description" content="Learning link previews" />
    <meta
      property="og:image"
      content="https://live.staticflickr.com/7504/16258492451_3a097a932a_k.jpg"
    />

    <!-- Twitter metas -->
    <meta property="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" />
    <meta property="twitter:url" content="a test url" />
    <meta name="twitter:site" content="shubham.codes" />
    <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@schwiftycold" />
    <meta property="twitter:title" content="My first link preview" />
    <meta property="twitter:description" content="Learning link previews" />
    <meta
      property="twitter:image"
      content="https://live.staticflickr.com/7504/16258492451_3a097a932a_k.jpg"
    />
  </head>
</html>
```

I'm calling it `link-preview.html`.
I want to show the title of the preview as "My first link preview".
We will use the image hosted by [IG](https://flic.kr/ps/jAWKs) as [Cool JavaScript Code at Game Jam](https://flic.kr/p/qLH2nn) under [Creative Commons License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/).
Later on, we will dynamically display the title on this image.

## Viewing & Debuggig

You can use [opengraph.xyz](https://www.opengraph.xyz/) to view your previews.
Some of the previews I saw on `opengraph.xyz` weren't exactly like what I saw on social media sites.
But for us, it's a handy tool to verify our previews.

We need a public link to our website for this to work.
Let's create a simple python HTTP server to serve our 'HTML' file.

```bash
# List the files in the present directory
> ls
link-preview.html

# Start a python server to serve our files to localhost:8000
> python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Now, you can browse the contents in the directory by visiting http://localhost:8000

Let's use 'locahost.run' or 'ngrok' to make this public.
Since there is no need for installation, I'm using `localhost.run`.
Run the below command to forward your port `8000` to `localhost.run`.
This will generate a new public link for your local server.
You can verify this by browsing the link.

```bash
> ssh -R 80:localhost:8080 nokey@localhost.run

===============================================================================
Welcome to localhost.run!

Follow your favorite reverse tunnel at [https://twitter.com/localhost_run].
...
dbf7d61ace7a14.lhr.life tunneled with tls termination, https://dbf7d61ace7a24.lhr.life
```

My public link is **https://dbf7d61ace7a24.lhr.life**.
I can view my HTML site by visiting **https://dbf7d61ace7a24.lhr.life/link-preview.html**.

Let's feed this URL to [opengrapth.xyz](https://www.opengraph.xyz/).

<BlogImageWithContext src={OpenGrapgDebugging} aspectRatio="16/9" width="768" alt="Preview of opengrapth.xyz" />

The right-hand side shows you the preview on `Facebook`, `Twitter`, `Linkedin` and `Discord`.

<BlogImageWithContext src={OpenGrapgDebuggingPreview} alt="Zoomed out preview of opengraph.xyz">
  This looks great. The image looks perfect. The provided title and description
  are also shown as expected.
</BlogImageWithContext>

## Make it dynamic

To add a title to the image you'll need to create a server to generate the image with the title.
There are many great libraries to do so. 
The one I'm using right now is a small modification of [Lance Ross](https://lanceross.xyz/) next.js implementation. 
But as we used `python` for hosting our main page, so let's stick to it. 

The idea is simple. 
We want to create a server that will look for a `GET` request with the title as a parameter. 
In the backend, we want to download this image, resize it to the recommended size and then add our title to it. 
After we are done with the modifications, we'll send the image as a response. 

We will use `Flask` as the server. 
The `Pillow` module will help us modify the image. 
And to download the initial image we were using, we will use the `get` method of the good old module called `requests`.

#### `requirements.txt`
```
Flask
pillow
requests
```

Let's expose `/og_image` for getting the image. 

#### `app.py`
```python
from flask import Flask, send_file, request
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont
import requests
from io import BytesIO

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/og_image')
def og_image():
    title = request.args.get('title')

    # This is the recommended size as per opengraph.xyz
    width = 1200
    height = 630

    # Let's get our image 
    response = requests.get('https://live.staticflickr.com/7504/16258492451_3a097a932a_k.jpg')
    image = Image.open(BytesIO(response.content))   
    image.thumbnail((width, height))      # This is how you resize an image

    # Draw the title on the image
    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(image)
    font = ImageFont.truetype('arial.ttf', 64)  # Font of the title

    # Calculate the x and y positions to center the text
    x = (width - draw.textsize(title, font=font)[0]) // 2
    y = (height - draw.textsize(title, font=font)[1]) // 2

    draw.text((x, y), title, font=font, fill=(255, 255, 0))

    # Save the image to a temporary file
    image.save('og_image.jpg')

    # Return the image
    return send_file('og_image.jpg', mimetype='image/jpeg')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, host='localhost', port=5000)
```

You can run the server using `python app.py`. By default, it uses port `5000`. 

> You can serve your HTML content from this server. But for simplicity, let's keep them as separate entities. 

Let's test if it's working by visiting `localhost:5000/og_image?title=My first Link Preview`

<BlogImage src={FlaskAppPreviewImage} alt="Flask app preview image" />

Seems like visiting "`localhost:5000/og_image?title=My first Link Preview`" is generating the image along with the title as expected.
Now let's expose this to the public temporarily using `localhost.run`. This time we will expose the port`5000`.

```bash
> ssh -R 80:localhost:5000 nokey@localhost.run
...
ccfa74e0bbe1c1.lhr.life tunneled with tls termination, https://ccfa74e0bbe1c1.lhr.life
```

> Reverse proxy may fail with the default server. So it is advisable to run the server using [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/). 

Let's add this to our simple HTML website.

```html
<head>
    ...
    <meta
      property="og:image"
      content="https://ccfa74e0bbe1c1.lhr.life/og_image?title=My%20first%20link%20preview"
    />
    ...
    <meta
      property="twitter:image"
      content="https://ccfa74e0bbe1c1.lhr.life/og_image?title=My%20first%20link%20preview"
    />
</head>
````

> Previewing it on [opengraph.xyz](https://opengraph.xyz) may not work as we are on a dev server and CORS is not defined. But this should work on the apps. 

<BlogImageWithContext src={SlackPreview} alt="slack preview" width="300">
    <div>Posting it on slack works perfectly. It should work the same for other social midia apps.</div> 
    <div>We can improve our testing by hosting the server on a hosting platform like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).</div>
