## General Introduction

You can add a preview of the link you share using social media apps.
This makes it possible for the reader to have a good idea of what's inside the content. 

<BlogImageWithContext src={LinkPreviewDemo} aspectRatio="1" width="200">
    The link shared on Dec 18 shows a preview consisting of a title and description. 
    The link shared on Dec 20 extends this preview by adding an image.
    This image is dynamically created by the server on receiving the request from the social media app.
</BlogImageWithContext>
