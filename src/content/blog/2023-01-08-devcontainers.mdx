## Problem 

I use a dual-booted ROG with **Ubuntu 22.10** and **Windows 10** for development, along with a **MacBook Air 2020**.
Every time I begin a new project that makes use of a new tech stack, I am required to take some time to set up the environment on all 3 machines.
And sometimes, my laziness compels me to use only one machine instead of setting up other ones. 
The issue is that I don't want to go through the same setup process again and again. 

The same problem exists on a bigger scale too. 
In [GreyOrange](https://www.greyorange.com/), I've seen my supervisors spending a lot of time helping freshers set up their new laptops. 
And even after following the setup guide on confluence, it took me a lot of time to build my first project successfully.
Imagine helping 300 freshers set up their laptops for a particular project. 

Plus, the building process can be different for different Operating Systems. 
Wouldn't it be great to use a system that your CICD platform uses?

This problem can be solved using **dev containers** that only require `Docker` and `git` installed on your machine. 

## Dev containers

Dev containers are just Docker containers that are fully equipped with the necessary tech stacks and tools to begin developing. 
Simply establish a connection with your container and begin writing code. 
Additionally, a version control program like `git` may be used to share this setup.
So, anyone with a computer may run these Docker containers and begin developing them. 
GitHub codespace uses dev container configurations to set up their cloud development environment. 
You can also customize your dev container using the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose` configurations. 

## Dev container custom configurations

A simple dev container configuration has a `.devcontainer` directory consisting of `devcontainer.json` and a `Dockerfile`.
The `devcontainer.json` contains all the configurations used by the container while `Dockerfile` contains the instruction to create a Docker container. 
You can also use an image from the Docker hub directly by using the `image` attribute. 

#### `Directory structure`
```bash
.devcontainer
├── Dockerfile
└── devcontainer.json
```

#### `devcontainer.json`
```json
{
	"name": "Hello DevContainer",   // This is the name of the container
    
    // build defines the image configurations
    // Instead of building you can use `image` attribute to provide the docker image hosted on Docker hub
    "build": {  
        "dockerfile": "Dockerfile", // This is the Dockerfile located at '.devcontainer/Dockerfile'
        "context": "..",            // This is where the project lies
        "args": {                   // Anything supplied to Dockerfile as an argument
            "PYTHON_VERSION": "3.9" 
        }
    },

	// Features to add to the dev container. More info: https://containers.dev/features.
	// "features": {},

	// Use 'forwardPorts' to make a list of ports inside the container available locally.
	// "forwardPorts": [],

	// Will run these after the container is created
    // Generally used to install the dependencies
	// "postCreateCommand": "pip install -r requirements.txt",

    // You can use root as remoteUser but it's not advisable to do so
	"remoteUser": "root"
}
```

#### `Dockerfile`
```docker
ARG PYTHON_VERSION
FROM python:${PYTHON_VERSION}.0-slim
# And other setup instructions
```

## Open your container in VSCode

To connect to a dev container using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you need to install [Dev Containers](vscode:extension/ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension. 
You can open your current directory in a dev container by clicking `F1` and selecting `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`. 
You can also choose `Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container` in case you want to build the Docker image once again. 

<BlogImageWithContext src={ReopenInaContainer} alt="Reopen folder in a container" width="768" aspectRatio="16/9"/>

This will take some time in building the container and installing the tools. 
Once completed, you can verify the connection by looking at the left end of the [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) window.
It should display `Dev Container: <Container name> @ <Operating system>` 

<BlogImageWithContext src={DevcontainerConnected} alt="Succcessfully connected to Dev Container" width="768" aspectRatio="16/9"/>

> Note: The extensions are gone. For your dev container, you'll need to add your extensions once again.

You can also check the python version to confirm if it's installed properly.
```bash
> root@2a35d5d14816:/workspaces/devcontainers# python --version
Python 3.9.0
```

## Open your container in a browser

You can also use the power of VSCode from your browser using [github.dev](https://github.com/github/dev) editor. 
You need to host your project on GitHub for this to work. 
Let's do that. 

First, you will need to add git features in `devcontainer.json` file.
This will enable us to use `git` and `github cli` from inside the container. 
You can also enable `ssh` using the `sshd` feature. 
A list of available features can be found at [containers.dev/features](https://containers.dev/features). 

```json
    ...
    "features": {
        "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/git:1": {},
        "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/github-cli:1": {},	
        "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/sshd:1": {}
    },
    ...
``` 

Then rebuild the container by pressing `F1` -> `Rebuild Container`.
Now you can use `git` and `gh` inside your container. 

```bash
> git init
> git add . 
> git commit -m "Init"
> gh auth login # Here you can create a new ssh key for your container
> gh repo create hello-devcontainer --public --source . --push
✓ Created repository GO-Shubham-Kumar/hello-devcontainer on GitHub
✓ Added remote git@github.com:GO-Shubham-Kumar/hello-devcontainer.git
Enumerating objects: 5, done.
Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.
Writing objects: 100% (5/5), 924 bytes | 71.00 KiB/s, done.

 * [new branch]      HEAD -> master
Branch 'master' set up to track remote branch 'master' from 'origin'.
✓ Pushed commits to git@github.com:GO-Shubham-Kumar/hello-devcontainer.git
```

The above procedure creates a new repository and pushes the project commits to it. 
I can see my project at [https://github.com/GO-Shubham-Kumar/hello-devcontainer](https://github.com/GO-Shubham-Kumar/hello-devcontainer).

Now we have our code on GitHub.
It's time to open a devcontainer using gitub.dev. 
For this simply visit your GitHub repo and change the URL from `github.com` to `github.dev`. 
This will launch a new VSCode-style window with all your tools available. 

<BlogImageWithContext src={BrowserCode} alt="Opening VSCode style editor in browser" width="768" aspectRatio="16/9"/>

> Note: github.dev is a lightweight editor which does not support a terminal. If you want to use the terminal, you should switch to GitHub Codespaces. 

## Creating a dev container using templates available

Above, I showed you how to configure a dev container using a test repository. 
Now, I'll show you how to use available templates to run services like `PostgreSQL` along with your container.

In [GreyOrange](https://www.greyorange.com/), we have a project that uses `SpringBoot` and `PostgreSQL`. 
We need a list of databases to run the test case for this project.
Let's try to configure our dev container to have a `PostgreSQL` service along with the databases required. 

Summary of things we need.

1. Java 8 and Maven
1. PostgreSQL 9.6
1. Populate the databases 

You can visit [container templates](https://containers.dev/templates.html) to search for a required template.
We will use, [Java & Postgres](https://github.com/devcontainers/templates/tree/main/src/java-postgres) template. 
This template allows us to configure the Java version, package manager and PostgreSQL version. 

> In case your template isn't available, you will need to create your `Dockerfile` & `docker-compose` files.

From your [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor, 
Click `F1` -> `Dev Containers: Add Dev Container Configuration Files...`. 
Click on  `Show All Definitions` and select `Java & PostgreSQL`. 
I'm using version `8-bullseye` with Maven so I'll select them. 
After a few moments, [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) will create a `.devcontainer` directory with `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml` & `devcontainer.json`.

Looking at the generated code it seems like we require some modifications for this to work properly.

1. We want to initialize the databases as per the `database_creator.sql`. 
This file contains all the databases we require to run the test cases. 
This can be done by adding an entry to the `db` -> `volume` as shown in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

2. The Java image should be `java:8-bullseye`, not `java:0-8-bullseye` which was generated by the generator. 

3. We need `Postgres:9.6`, the generated one point to the latest image.

#### `devcontainer.json`
```json
// For format details, see https://aka.ms/devcontainer.json. For config options, see the
// README at: https://github.com/devcontainers/templates/tree/main/src/java-postgres
{
	"name": "Java & PostgreSQL",
	"dockerComposeFile": "docker-compose.yml",
	"service": "app",
	"workspaceFolder": "/workspaces/${localWorkspaceFolderBasename}"
}
```

#### `Dockerfile`
```docker
# Changed java:0-8-bullseye to java:8-bullseye
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/java:8-bullseye

ARG INSTALL_MAVEN="true"
ARG MAVEN_VERSION=""

ARG INSTALL_GRADLE="false"
ARG GRADLE_VERSION=""

RUN if [ "${INSTALL_MAVEN}" = "true" ]; then su vscode -c "umask 0002 && . /usr/local/sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh && sdk install maven \"${MAVEN_VERSION}\""; fi \
    && if [ "${INSTALL_GRADLE}" = "true" ]; then su vscode -c "umask 0002 && . /usr/local/sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh && sdk install gradle \"${GRADLE_VERSION}\""; fi

```

#### `docker-compose.yml`
```yaml
version: '3.8'

volumes:
  postgres-data:

services:
  app:
    container_name: javadev
    build: 
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    environment:
      # NOTE: POSTGRES_DB/USER/PASSWORD should match values in db container
        POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
        POSTGRES_USER: postgres
        POSTGRES_DB: postgres
        # We will populate the database using database_creator.sql
        # POSTGRES_HOSTNAME: postgresdb 

    volumes:
      - ../..:/workspaces:cached
    command: sleep infinity

    # Runs app on the same network as the database container, allows "forwardPorts" in devcontainer.json function.
    network_mode: service:db

    # Use "forwardPorts" in **devcontainer.json** to forward an app port locally. 
    # (Adding the "ports" property to this file will not forward from a Codespace.)

  db:
    container_name: postgresdb
    image: postgres:9.6
    restart: always
    volumes:
      # Run the below script as an initialization script 
      - ../misc/database_creator.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/database_creator.sql
      # We no longer require this
      # - postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      # NOTE: POSTGRES_DB/USER/PASSWORD should match values in app container
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      # We will create our databases using misc/database_creator.sql
      # POSTGRES_DB: postgres

    # Add "forwardPorts": ["5432"] to **devcontainer.json** to forward PostgreSQL locally.
    # (Adding the "ports" property to this file will not forward from a Codespace.)
```

The above configurations will run `PostgreSQL` along with our app. 
You can also view this combination in Docker Desktop. 

<BlogImageWithContext src={RunningPostgresAndApp} alt="Postgres and Java App in Docker Desktop" width="768" aspectRatio="16/9"/>

> Note: Here I haven't used `git` and `gh` features because the image `java:8-bullseye` already comes with these tools. 

Let's verify the `Java` and `Maven` versions.

```bash
> java -version
openjdk version "1.8.0_352"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (Temurin)(build 1.8.0_352-b08)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (Temurin)(build 25.352-b08, mixed mode)
> mvn -version
Apache Maven 3.8.7 (b89d5959fcde851dcb1c8946a785a163f14e1e29)
Maven home: /usr/local/sdkman/candidates/maven/current
Java version: 1.8.0_352, vendor: Temurin, runtime: /usr/local/sdkman/candidates/java/8.0.352-tem/jre
Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: UTF-8
OS name: "linux", version: "5.15.49-linuxkit", arch: "aarch64", family: "unix"
```

Let's compile the project.

```bash
> mvn clean install
...
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Total time:  35:03 min
[INFO] Finished at: 2023-01-08T00:05:51Z
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

It took a while but the build was successful. 

## Adding fish terminal to the dev container

Right now, the dev container is using `bash` as it's the default shell. 
There are a lot of shells that come along with this image. 

```bash
> echo $SHELL
/bin/bash

> cat /etc/shells
/bin/sh
/bin/bash
/bin/rbash
/bin/dash
/bin/zsh
/usr/bin/zsh
```

Let's try installing [fish](https://fishshell.com/) terminal which is not available by default.
`fish` can be installed using the features option in `devcontainer.json`. 
A list of features is available [here](https://containers.dev/features).

Modify the `devcontainer.json` as shown below and rebuild the container.

#### `devcontainer.json`
```json
{
    ...
    "features": {
		"ghcr.io/meaningful-ooo/devcontainer-features/fish:1": {}
	}
}
```

Now, you can find `fish` in the list of available shells. And this feature also sets `fish` as your default terminal. 

```bash
> cat /etc/shells
/bin/sh
/bin/bash
/bin/rbash
/bin/dash
/bin/zsh
/usr/bin/zsh
/usr/bin/fish   # This is it
```

<BlogImageWithContext src={Fish} alt="Fish terminal" width="768" aspectRatio="16/9"/>

If you don't want to set `fish` as your default terminal, you can specify the default terminal in `devcontainer.json` file as follows.
This will set `bash` as your default container. 

#### `devcontainer.json`
```json
{
  ...
	"settings": { 
		"terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.linux": "bash", 
		"terminal.integrated.profiles.linux": { 
			"bash": { 
				"path": "bash" 
				} 
			} 
		}
  ...
}
```

## oh-my-zsh with powerlevel10k

`fish` is a great shell. 
But I want the dev container to feel like my local machine that has `oh-my-zsh` with [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k). 
At the time of writing this blog, I wasn't able to find any features to install these things.
So I went with configuring the `Dockerfile` itself to include these features.

> Disclaimer: This is a very bad idea to directly change a source controlled dev container file as per your preference

This image already comes with [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/). [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) is a custom theme that I'll need to install on my own.
Same goes for [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) and [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) plugins. 

#### `Dockerfile`
```docker
...
# Install powerlevel10k
RUN git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git /home/vscode/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/powerlevel10k
# Install zsh-autosuggestions
RUN git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions /home/vscode/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
# Install zsh-syntax-highlighting
RUN git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git /home/vscode/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
# This is my local machine's theme file 
COPY .p10k.zsh /home/vscode
# This is the modified zsh configuration
COPY .zshrc /home/vscode
``` 

`.p10k.zsh` contains the [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) configurations. 
`.zshrc` contains the `zsh` configurations.
These files are located inside the home directory. 
I just copied them to `.devcontainer` for an easy transfer to the dev container. 

```bash
> tree -a .devcontainer
.devcontainer
├── .p10k.zsh
├── .zshrc
├── Dockerfile
├── devcontainer.json
└── docker-compose.yml
```

> If you don't have the `.p10k.zsh`, you can skip the COPY step while building the container. Once inside the container, you can run `p10k configure` to generate the `.p10k.zsh` file. Then the contents of this file can be copied to `.devcontainer/.p10k.zsh` for future builds. 

Below is my `.zshrc` file. You can verify the `ZSH_THEME` is set as `powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k`.
I am just using 3 plugins. The `git` plugin is available by default. `zsh-autosuggestions` and `zsh-syntax-highlighting` were downloaded from GitHub. 

```bash
# Enable Powerlevel10k instant prompt. Should stay close to the top of ~/.zshrc.
# Initialization code that may require console input (password prompts, [y/n]
# confirmations, etc.) must go above this block; everything else may go below.
if [[ -r "${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/p10k-instant-prompt-${(%):-%n}.zsh" ]]; then
  source "${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/p10k-instant-prompt-${(%):-%n}.zsh"
fi

export ZSH="$HOME/.oh-my-zsh"

ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"

plugins=(
	git
	zsh-autosuggestions
	zsh-syntax-highlighting
)

source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh

# To customize prompt, run `p10k configure` or edit ~/.p10k.zsh.
[[ ! -f ~/.p10k.zsh ]] || source ~/.p10k.zsh
```

<BlogImageWithContext src={Powerlevel10k} alt="oh-my-zsh with powerlevel10k terminal" width="768" aspectRatio="16/9"/>

> If there are multiple developers with their shell preference, modification of `Dockerfile` for a specific need is not a very good idea. 

## Make the dev container distributable

You should not change a source controlled `Dockerfile` to satisfy your need. 
The current `Dockerfile` contains the changes I made to suit my preference. 
I like `zsh` so I did some customization to Docker to support my theming style.
If I commit these changes to the remote, this might become a problem for another developer who prefers some other shell or theme.
Plus, if everyone starts making changes to the dev container configuration, this might result in merge conflicts. 

In scenarios like this, you can use the git `skip-worktree` feature. 
After cloning the base repo, you don't want to make any commits on the dev container. 
So you can tell git to ignore tracking the `.devcontainer` directory.

```bash
# Tell git to stop tracking these files
> git update-index --assume-unchanged .devcontainer/*

# View the files which are not being tracked
> git ls-files -v | grep "h" | grep dev
h .devcontainer/Dockerfile
h .devcontainer/devcontainer.json
h .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml
```

Now you can freely configure the dev container as per your need. 

> Actually, this is not the best way to deal with this problem at all, as this will ignore the `.devcontainer` directory even in the case of `git pull`. 
And if you do the reverse using `git update-index --no-assume-unchanged .devcontainer/*`, you will need to commit or discard your changes before proceeding. 

The best way I can think of to deal with this problem is by keeping the personal installations away from the git repository.

For this, let's create an external script that will install `powerlevel10k` and other plugins using the `docker` commands. 

First, let's move our `.zshrc` and `.p10k.zsh` to a new directory out of our repository.
I'm creating a hidden directory in the `home` directory for this. 

```bash
> mkdir ~/.personal-devcontainer 
> mv .devcontainer/.zshrc ~/.personal-devcontainer
> mv .devcontainer/.p10k.zsh ~/.personal-devcontainer
```

Also, let's reset the `devcontainer.json`, `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` to the unbiased version.

#### `devcontainer.json`
```json
// For format details, see https://aka.ms/devcontainer.json. For config options, see the
// README at: https://github.com/devcontainers/templates/tree/main/src/java-postgres
{
	"name": "Java & PostgreSQL",
	"dockerComposeFile": "docker-compose.yml",
	"service": "app",
	"workspaceFolder": "/workspaces/${localWorkspaceFolderBasename}"
}
```

#### `Dockerfile`
```docker
# Changed java:0-8-bullseye to java:8-bullseye
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/java:8-bullseye

ARG INSTALL_MAVEN="true"
ARG MAVEN_VERSION=""

ARG INSTALL_GRADLE="false"
ARG GRADLE_VERSION=""

RUN if [ "${INSTALL_MAVEN}" = "true" ]; then su vscode -c "umask 0002 && . /usr/local/sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh && sdk install maven \"${MAVEN_VERSION}\""; fi \
    && if [ "${INSTALL_GRADLE}" = "true" ]; then su vscode -c "umask 0002 && . /usr/local/sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh && sdk install gradle \"${GRADLE_VERSION}\""; fi

```

#### `docker-compose.yml`
```yaml
version: '3.8'

volumes:
  postgres-data:

services:
  app:
    container_name: javadev
    build: 
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    environment:
      # NOTE: POSTGRES_DB/USER/PASSWORD should match values in db container
        POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
        POSTGRES_USER: postgres
        POSTGRES_DB: postgres
        # We will populate the database using database_creator.sql
        # POSTGRES_HOSTNAME: postgresdb 

    volumes:
      - ../..:/workspaces:cached
    command: sleep infinity

    # Runs app on the same network as the database container, allows "forwardPorts" in devcontainer.json function.
    network_mode: service:db

    # Use "forwardPorts" in **devcontainer.json** to forward an app port locally. 
    # (Adding the "ports" property to this file will not forward from a Codespace.)

  db:
    container_name: postgresdb
    image: postgres:9.6
    restart: always
    volumes:
      # Run the below script as an initialization script 
      - ../misc/database_creator.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/database_creator.sql
      # We no longer require this
      # - postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      # NOTE: POSTGRES_DB/USER/PASSWORD should match values in app container
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      # We will create our databases using misc/database_creator.sql
      # POSTGRES_DB: postgres

    # Add "forwardPorts": ["5432"] to **devcontainer.json** to forward PostgreSQL locally.
    # (Adding the "ports" property to this file will not forward from a Codespace.)
```

Now, let's create a bash script inside `~/.personal-devcontainer` that will change the container configuration as per our preference (personal changes).

```bash
> cd ~/.personal-devcontainer
> touch install.sh
> chmod +x install.sh
> vim install.sh
```

#### `install.sh`
```bash
# This will work on a running dev container
CONTAINER_NAME=$1
docker exec $CONTAINER_NAME git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git /home/vscode/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/powerlevel10k
docker exec $CONTAINER_NAME git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions /home/vscode/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
docker exec $CONTAINER_NAME git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git /home/vscode/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
docker cp ~/.personal-devcontainer/.p10k.zsh $CONTAINER_NAME:/home/vscode/.p10k.zsh
docker cp ~/.personal-devcontainer/.zshrc $CONTAINER_NAME:/home/vscode/.zshrc
docker exec $CONTAINER_NAME chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

Now you can just run `./install.sh javadev` to install the preferences to the javadev container (which is our development container name).
As I'll keep changing the script depending on my projects, I'll publish the installation scripts repo to my [git repo](https://github.com/GO-Shubham-Kumar/personal-devcontainer.git). 

There are 2 problems with this method -
1. You will require to run the script on every rebuild.
2. You cannot directly use this script online with `github.dev`. 

For easier access, let's create an alias for the script. It will take a container name as a parameter and will configure the shell as required. 

#### `.zshrc`
```bash
...
# configure-personal-dev-container javadev
function configure-personal-dev-container {
	if [[ -z $1 ]]; then 
		echo Please provide a container name
		exit 1
	else
		~/.personal-devcontainer/install.sh $1
	fi
}
...
```

Now, I can run `configure-personal-dev-container javadev` from anywhere. 

## Conclusion

Dev container helps us to reduce the setup time for a project. 
We started with creating a simple dev container configuration. 
We used the power of dev containers to open the project in `VSCode` and `github.dev`.
Then we created a complex dev container configuration consisting of `Java` & `Maven` with `PostgreSQL` installation and database creation for an ongoing project at [GreyOrange](https://www.greyorange.com/). 
We tried to compile our project inside the dev container which worked as expected.
Then we moved to configure the `shell` inside the dev container. 
We tried `fish` and `zsh` with `powerlevel10k` which is what I use locally. 
We also learned to configure the dev container for personal development without disturbing the source-controlled setup configurations.
