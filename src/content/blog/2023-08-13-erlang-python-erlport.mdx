When it comes to fault-tolerant systems, there are very few languages that can beat `Erlang`.
While `Erlang` is a great language for building fault-tolerant systems, it is not the best language for building AI/ML applications.
There are instances where you would want to use `Python` for building AI/ML applications and `Erlang` for building fault-tolerant systems.
In such cases, you would want to use `Erlang` and `Python` together.
This is where [Erlport library](http://erlport.org/) comes in.

But before understanding Erlport, you need an understanding of `ports` in Erlang.

## Ports

In simple terms, `ports` are used to communicate with external programs which are not written in Erlang.
So if you have a C program or a Python program and you want to communicate with it from Erlang, you can use `ports`.
It's not a restriction that you can only use `ports` to communicate with external programs, you can also use `ports` to communicate with other Erlang nodes.
`Port` provides you with a byte-oriented interface.
Which means, you send a list of bytes and receive a list of bytes during the communication.
This also means you need to handle the encoding and decoding of the data at both ends by yourself.

## Erlport

Erlport is a library that internally uses the `port` mechanism for communication and provides a wrapper around it.
This makes the integration of Erlang and Python very easy.
Right now, Erlport supports Python and Ruby.
In this article, we will be focusing on Erlang and Python implementation.

### Installation

If you are using `rebar3` for building your Erlang application, you can add the following dependency to your `rebar.config` file.

```erlang
...
{deps, [
    erlport
]}.
...
```

Or you can use the GitHub link for the dependency.

```erlang
{erl_opts, [debug_info]}.
{deps, [
  {erlport, {git, "https://github.com/erlport/erlport.git", {tag, "v0.10.1"}}}
]}.
```

You'll also need to tell `Erlang` to wait for the dependencies to be available before starting the app.
This can be done by adding the entry in `*.app.src` file.

```erlang
 {applications,
   [kernel,
    stdlib,
    erlport
   ]},
```

### Python program

Let's create an `add` program in Python and keep the file in the `priv` directory.

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

### Erlang program

The `Erlang` program will initialize the Python port using `python:start/1` function.
And will call the `add` function of the Python program using `python:call/4` function.
The `python:call/4` function takes the `Pid` of the Python port, the module name, the function name, and the list of arguments to be passed to the function.

Here, my `Python` module is named, `math` and the function is `add` with `2` and `4` as parameters.

```erlang
-module(main).
-export([call_python/0]).

call_python() ->
  PythonCodePath = code:priv_dir(aiml_model_wrapper),
  {ok, P} = python:start([{python_path, PythonCodePath}, {python, "python3"}]),
  python:call(P, math, add, [2, 4]).

```

### Running the program

Running the program is as simple as compiling and running the `Erlang` program.

```bash
reabr3 compile
reabr3 shell
1> main:call_python().
```

## Conclusion

In this article, we saw how we can use `Erlang` and `Python` together using `Erlport`.
This is a very simple example of how you can use `Erlang` and `Python` together.
You can use this to build complex systems where you can use `Erlang` for building fault-tolerant systems and `Python` for building AI/ML applications.
At [GreyOrange](https://www.greyorange.com) we used this to build a library to wrap our AI/ML models and use them in our `Erlang` server.
