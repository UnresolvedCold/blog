## Introduction

`PMML` is a markup language to save your AI/ML model files 
so that you can use them for predictions later on 
(maybe during production).
`cPMML` is a library created by the 
[AmadeusITGroup](https://github.com/AmadeusITGroup/cPMML) 
to parse and run predictions in C++.
In this blog, we will train a linear regression model in 
`python` and generate a `pmml` file and then we will 
run our predictions in `C++`.

## Creating a model file

### Dependencies

We will need `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn` and `sklearn2pmml`.

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn sklearn2pmml
```

#### Imports
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn2pmml import sklearn2pmml
from sklearn2pmml.pipeline import PMMLPipeline
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
```

### The model 

#### Dataset

For keeping things simple, let's train a linear regression model
to match the equation, `y = 2x + 1`.
We can generate a random dataset for this equation.

```python
X = np.random.rand(100, 1)
Y = 2 * X + 1 + 0.1 * np.random.randn(100, 1)
```

#### Test/Train data

Next, we'll divide the data into test and train datasets.

```python
df = pd.DataFrame({'X': X.flatten(), 'Y': Y.flatten()})
train_df, test_df = train_test_split(df, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
X_train = train_df[['X']]
y_train = train_df['Y']
X_test = test_df[['X']]
y_test = test_df['Y']
```

#### Training the model

For training the model, we can get the model from scikit 
learn library and use the dataset we generated above.
We can also check the `mse` to get an idea of the model's accuracy.

```python
pipeline = PMMLPipeline([
    ("regressor", LinearRegression())
])

pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)

y_pred = pipeline.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
```

#### Saving the pmml file

If you are satisfied by the performance of your model, you can 
export the model as a pmml file.
We will save the model with the name, `lr_model.pmml`

```python
sklearn2pmml(pipeline, "lr_model.pmml", with_repr = True)
```

## Using the model file  

The main step of focus in this blog is using the model in C++ program.
For this, you will need to isntall the `cPMML` library. 

### Installing cPMML

To install the libray in your system, you just need to run the below command.
This will run `cmake`, so you should have `cmake` installed in your system.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmadeusITGroup/cPMML.git && cd cPMML && ./install.sh
```

#### For Mac M1

I ran into some problems while installing this on Mac M1. 
Here are the steps to install this effortlessly.

1. Ensure you have the latest version of `cmake` installed in your system.
2. You can edit the `install.sh` script to remove `-j 4` flag from the `cmake -j 4 ..` command. This will turn off the multi processing.
3. The last line of the `install.sh` script is `sudo ldconfig`. Change this to `sudo update_dyld_shared_cache`. This installs the `.dylib` or `.so` library files to proper destination. 

### Running the predictions 

#### Include the library
The first thing is to import the library.

```cpp
#include "cPMML.h"
#include <iostream>
```

#### Load the model

Then you can load the model.

```cpp
int main() {
  cpmml::Model model("lr_model.pmml");
  return 0;
}
```

#### Start predictions

The `cPMML` library takes input as an unordered_map of strings.
For us, there is only one input which is `X`.

```cpp
int main() {
  cpmml::Model model("lr_model.pmml");

  // This shoule yield a value close to 1
  std::unordered_map<std::string, std::string> input1 = {
    {"X", "0"}
  };


  // This should yield a value close to 21
  std::unordered_map<std::string, std::string> input2 = {
    {"X", "10"}
  };

  std::cout<<"X = 0 Y = "<<model.predict(input1)<<'\n';
  std::cout<<"X = 10 Y = "<<model.predict(input2)<<'\n';
  
  return 0;
}
```

#### Compilation

You can compile the code by including the `cPMML` library.

```bash
> g++ -std=c++11 predict.cpp -o predict.o -lcPMML
> ./predict.o
X = 0 Y = 0.967265
X = 10 Y = 21.369305
```

## Conclusion

In this blog, we saw how to store your model as a `PMML` file and load it in `C++` using `cPMML` library.
