* Introduction

During my time in GreyOrange, I faced a problem where we needed to sort an array of non-associative elements.
This means, if I have 3 elements ~a, b, c~ with ~a < b~ and ~b < c~. I cannot say ~a < c~ or ~c > b~ or ~b > a~.
With a mind trained in everyday Mathematics, this seems is quite non-intuitive.
Let me explain this a bit further.

* Detailed Explanation

Let's say a, b and c are set of numerically sorted integers with ~a=(0,0), b=(0,1)~ and ~c=(1,1)~.
And my comparator compares x and y such that ~x < y~ if any element of y > largest element of x and ~x > y~ if any element of y < smallest element of x. Consider them equal otherwise.

Using the above logic, a < b because 1 is an element of b which is greater than the largest element of a which is 0.
Using the same logic ~a < c~.
Comparing c and b. Is any alement of b > 1 (largest element of c) -> NO. Is any element of b < 1 (smallest element of c) -> Yes.
So ~c > b~.
using the same logic ~c > a~.

Which means we have ~a < b~ and ~b < c~ and so the sorted order for these elements is ~a < b < c~.

But what about comparing b and c.
Is any element of c > largest element of b -> NO.
Is any element of c < smallest element of b -> NO.
So b == c? Yes

This is what we call non-associativity and non-commutativity.
The merge sort will fail here.
The main question is how can we write an algorithm to sort these non-associative elements?

* Why merge sort fails here?

Let's try to solve this using ~Java~ with a custom comparator.
This ~Collections.sort~ method uses a modified version of Merge sort called Tim sort.
Understanding why this fails for merge sort will give us an insight why it fails for other algorithms also.

** Merge sort code

Merge sort consists of 3 things - divide, compare and merge.
It just says, divide the array in 2 halves and merge them in order.
Dividing the array takes ~O(nlogn)~ while merging is an ~O(n)~ operation.

Let's implement the mergesort and merge logic as follows.
~mergeSort~ function divides the array in 2 parts and sorts both and merge them.
~merge~ function is just comparing the elememts of both the arrays and creating a result based on that.

    if (arr.size() < 2) {

    int mid = arr.size() / 2;
    List<T> left = arr.subList(0, mid);
    List<T> right = arr.subList(mid, arr.size());
    mergeSort(left, cmp);
    mergeSort(right, cmp);
    merge(arr, left, right, cmp);
    System.out.println(arr);
}

private static <T> void merge(List<T> result, List<T> left, List<T> right, Comparator<? super T> cmp) {
    int i = 0, j = 0, k = 0;
    while (i < left.size() && j < right.size()) {
        if (cmp.compare(left.get(i), right.get(j)) > 0) {
            result.set(k++, right.get(j++));
        } else if (cmp.compare(left.get(i), right.get(j)) < 0){
            result.set(k++, left.get(i++));
        } else {
            System.out.println(left.get(i++) + " -- " + right.get(j++));

    }
    while (i < left.size()) {
        result.set(k++, left.get(i++));
    }
    while (j < right.size()) {
        result.set(k++, right.get(j++));
    }

** The Problem



** Explanation

The ~Merge~ sort failed in this case.
Here, b=(0,1), c=(1,1) and a=(0,0)
