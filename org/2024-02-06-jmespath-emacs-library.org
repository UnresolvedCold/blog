* Introduction

When you have a small JSON file, it is quite easy to look for what you want.
But querying a large JSON data is very troublesome.

This is where people use tools like Jmespath to filter and transform data into their liking.
This post is about a small wrapper over `jp` CLI utility that you can use while working on JSON files in Emacs.

* Installing JP

** Linux

On Linux, you can install the utility by first downloding the binary and then installing it.
#+begin_src bash
sudo wget https://github.com/jmespath/jp/releases/latest/download/jp-linux-amd64 \
  -O /usr/local/bin/jp  && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/jp
#+end_src

** Mac
On Mac, you can install Jmespath CLI using `brew`.
#+begin_src bash
brew install jmespath/jmespath/jp
#+end_src

* Adding Jmespath recipe in Emacs

This is my first recipe that I published on [[https://melpa.org/][MELPA]].
Here are the steps to install it in ~Doom~ using ~straight~.
You can use any package manager to install it using ~MELPA~ repository.

** Doom Emacs

1. On Doom, you can just mention the below recipe in your ~package.el~.
#+begin_src elisp
(package! jmespath)
#+end_src

2. Also, add the below line in your ~config.el~.
#+begin_src elisp
(use-package jmespath)
#+end_src

* Using Jmespath

There is an interactive function, ~jmespath-query-and-show~ that you can use to query the currently opened buffer or a file.
To use it with current buffer, you can simply call this function and enter your query.
The output will be shown on a new buffer with name *JMESPath Result*.

To use this with a different file, you can set the ~Universal Argument~ using ~C-u~ or ~SPC-u~ (using evil).
Then you can enter the file to execute the query on.
